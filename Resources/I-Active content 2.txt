A serviced office is an office or office building that is fully equipped and managed by a facility management company,

which then rents individual offices or floors to other companies. 

Serviced offices, which are also referred to as managed offices, business centers, executive suites or executive centers, are often found in the business districts of large cities around the world. 

A serviced office broker will commonly help business centre owners and facility management companies to rent serviced office space.

Companies offering serviced offices are generally able to offer more flexible rental terms, as opposed to a conventional leased office which may require furnishing, equipment, and more restrictive leases. 

Space is normally flexible, allowing for additional space to be allocated at short notice, should the size of an individual business change. 

Serviced office providers often allow tenants to share reception services, business machines and other resources, providing reduced costs and access to equipment which may otherwise be unaffordable.
